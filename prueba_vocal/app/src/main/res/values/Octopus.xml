        \nAs he admired it, he noticed a small crab crying nearby. The crab explained that the shell was his lost home.
        \nFeeling empathetic, Ollie decided to return the shell to the crab. The crab was overjoyed and thanked Ollie for his kindness.
        \nIn return, the crab gave Ollie a special pearl. Ollie learned that helping others brought him more happiness than any shiny object ever could.</string>
