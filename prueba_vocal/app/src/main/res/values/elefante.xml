    <string name="elefante">Once upon a time, Ellie the Elephant loved exploring. One sunny day, Ellie wandered away from her herd, curious about the sparkling river nearby.
        \nAs she splashed in the water, she noticed a tiny fish struggling in a shallow puddle.
        \nUsing her long trunk, Ellie gently lifted the fish and placed it back into the river.The fish swam happily away, and Ellie felt proud of her good deed.
        \nWhen she returned to her herd, she shared her adventure, and they all cheered for her kindness and bravery.
