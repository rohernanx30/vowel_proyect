    <string name="iguana">Izzy the Iguana lived in a lush, green forest. She enjoyed basking in the sun but felt lonely sometimes.
        \nOne day, while climbing a tall tree, she met a colorful bird named Bella.
        \nBella was looking for a place to build her nest and asked Izzy for help. Izzy showed Bella the perfect spot in a nearby tree.
        \nBella was grateful and invited Izzy to visit her nest anytime. From then on, Izzy and Bella became best friends, sharing stories and enjoying their beautiful forest home together.</string>
